## Greetings,

This blog will contain all my development activities, I will mainly talk about Godot engine,Pixel Art, Data Science and all its related subjects.
It should be interesting. the more we learn the more power we gain so as i wise man once said : 

> with great power comes great responsibility.

Lets hope it will be an interesting journey :) .
